> # HTML & CSS:

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes and so on.

There are three ways to use CSS in HTML documents:
1. Inline :- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.

2. Internal - by using a `<style>` element in the `<head>` section.

3. External - by using a `<link>` element to link to an external CSS file.
