> # HTML Tables:

HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.
- The `<table>` tag defines an HTML table.

- Each table row is defined with a `<tr>` tag. Each table header is defined with a `<th>` tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a `<td>` tag.

- By default, the text in `<th>` elements are bold and centered.

- By default, the text in `<td>` elements are regular and left-aligned.
