> # HTML Block and Inline Elements:

Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.There are two display values: block and inline.

1. Block-level Elements:

    A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.For example:`<div>` tag , etc.

2. Inline Elements:
    
    An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary.For example: `<span>` tag , etc.
